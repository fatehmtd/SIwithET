# Instructions for Using the Test Suite

The test suite is built from using using the Google Test Framework which is found at https://github.com/google/googletest.  The orginal test suite was written using CPPUnit but was converted over to Google Test around August 2018.  You may still see commented out code in some of the tests which were from CPPUnit.

Build googletest has its seperate directory then update the paths to where the libraries for GoogleTest are located.
